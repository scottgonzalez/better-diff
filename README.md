# Better Diff

## Overview

Better Diff is an attempt at massively improving the user experience associated with diff viewing. Diff tools today are extremely useful, but they leave a lot to be desired.

### Naming

The name of this project is still TBD. Until a name is chosen, we'll use the name Better Diff.

## Main Goals

* Generate diffs based on Concrete Syntax Trees (CSTs).
* Apply syntax highlighting to the generated diffs.
* Support popular version control systems.

## Contributing

If you're interested in helping with the implementation, please leave a comment on the [Find Contributors issue](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/better-diff/issues/1) issue. This will likely require many contributors before we have a viable solution. No contribution is too small!

### Ideas? Comments? Concerns?

Please file issues for any feedback you may have.
